# draggablePin
Sample application showing how to create a custom MKAnnotation for a draggable pin or annotation and the use of the CLLocationManagerDelegate for iOS MapKit.

We created a simple app to show how to create a custom MKAnnotation that allows the pin to be dragged and dropped in a new position.  This also demonstrates the use of the CLLocationManagerDelegate to grab the initial coordinates for the Map.  Happy Coding!
